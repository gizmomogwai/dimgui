* DImgUI

Fork of [[https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/dimgui][https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/dimgui]] which is itself a
fork of the abandoned [[https://github.com/AdrienHerubel/imgui][https://github.com/AdrienHerubel/imgui]].

I would like to upstream my changes again, but I think it's too far
digressed. I am very thankful for the original dimgui port, as it
showed to be very hack- and adjustable to my needs!
