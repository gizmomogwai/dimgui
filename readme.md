This is a D port of the [imgui] OpenGL GUI library.

**dimgui** is an [immediate-mode] GUI library.

Homepage: https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/dimgui

## Supported compilers

Currently requires DMD v2.071.0, not tested with other compilers,
and not frequently tested on Windows.

## Examples

Use [dub] to build and run the example project:

```
# Shows a nice demo of the various UI elements.
$ dub run dimgui:demo

# Shows how to properly handle memory management.
$ dub run dimgui:memory
```

Note: You will need to install the [glfw] shared library in order to run the example.

## Real-world examples

**dimgui** is used in the following projects:

- [dbox] - The 2D physics library uses **dimgui** for its interactive test-suite.

## Documentation

The public API is available in the [imgui.api] module.

## Memory Management

For efficiency reasons [imgui] will batch all commands and will render the current frame
once **imguiRender** is called. Calls to UI-defining functions such as **imguiLabel** will
store a reference to the passed-in string and will not draw the string immediately.

This means you should not pass in memory allocated on the stack unless you can guarantee that:

- The memory on the stack will live up to the point **imguiRender** is called.
- The memory passed to the UI-defining functions is unique for each call.

An example of both improper and proper memory management is shown in the [memory] example.

## Building dimgui as a static library

Run [dub] alone in the root project directory to build **dimgui** as a static library:

```
$ dub
```

- try to get rid of normals and of texture coordinates for normal rendering with white TEXTURE
